The discovery of how to wield fire would go on to completely change the course of history and human behaviour. Its discovery would give humanity the means to stay warm at night, cook food, ward off predators, negate the issues faced from early nights in winter seasons allowing humans settle further from the equator, and settle in environments that were colder or more exposed to the elements. Fire would also introduce new social behaviours in humans, it would encourage early humans to group together and stay up much later, taking the first steps necessary in creating early settlements and eventually empires. The ability to cook with fire would also bring biological changes to humans through evolution. Early humans used to have much larger molar teeth that were perfect for hard foods such as large seeds, once humans had developed cooking as a skill, these molars shrank to accommodate the softer foods that came with cooked foods. Cooking also made our food easier to digest, as a result, our digestive system also shrank.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">When humans discovered fire isn’t exactly known, the earliest evidence we have of humans using fire dates back 1,000,000 years ago. It was found inside the Wonderwerk cave in South Africa. The evidence consisted of charred bones and plant ashes, showing us that around this time early humans were starting to cook their food. Many argue though that fire was likely discovered earlier than this time period as there are other specimens dating back 1,500,000 years, although these specimens were found outdoors meaning that their legitimacy is questionable as evidence found there could be caused by a source unrelated to humans, such as wildfires.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">Without any actual records in the form of writing or prehistoric art, we can’t actually tell how early humans created their fires. What has become commonly accepted is the notion among archaeologists is that learning to control fire was a gradual process that happended in stages. It likely started with early humans interacting with naturally occurring forest fires, it would then progress to the carrying of burning material back to their campsites and then lastly learning how to make fire within the campfire, either with a wooden hand drill or using flint with tinder.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">In the future fire would go on to be harnessed in countless new ways, it would be a vital part of many of the processes that we rely on so heavily to this day. In our ancient civilizations fire would be used in the processes that would bring an end to the stone age such as bronzeworking and other later forms metalworking, pottery and glass blowing. These early processes such as metalworking would improve upon many of the already established inventions such as crafting of tools, while also opening doors for the inventions we use today, that was not possible with the previously available technology. Today, fire is just as vital if not more to the success of our society, the majority of inventions that we use on a daily basis rely on fire in some capacity, such as our electricity grid, the processes we use to mass produce steel and the combustion power we use to power our vehicles.</p>
        
    
                <p class="articlepara">Today, our society relies heavily on fire to function, the majority of inventions require it and despite this, the average person actually has very little contact with fire itself, unless their job or hobbies entail its use. The average person encounters fire less today than they did in past as many of the things we relied on fire to provide have been replaced with alternatives, such as heating systems replacing fire for heat and ovens replacing fire for cooking. While both of these replacements rely on fire to provide their electricity, the average person does not need to provide the electricity for alternatives. The cooking with fire we adopted after fire’s discovery has evolved dramatically and become much more popular. It has become an extremely common practice with almost every single meal we eat being cooked. We have learnt to use fire in hundreds of different ways to prepare food, from grilling to stewing. Our cooking has also improved immensely through experimentation with herbs and spices for seasoning and through improved cooking technology.</p>
