The advent of agriculture is likely the largest contributor to the explosive technological progression we have experience in the last 12,000 years. While early stone tools make us effective hunters, we couldn’t truly thrive without a reliable source of food capable of sustaining large populations, agriculture would be the solution to this problem. Agriculture brought an end to the nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle instead, we began to settle down and develop our culture and new technologies. The nomadic lifestyle poorly suited the needs required to invent new technology or develop our culture as the travelling lifestyle required early humans to carry light, leaving behind anything that wasn’t vital for survival. In contrast, the settler lifestyle didn’t have these travelling requirements, allowing early humans to invent new technology even if it could not be transported easily and to erect monuments for their culture.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The earliest form of agriculture to be adopted by early humans started in the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia, a region that was comprised of portions of modern; Iraq, Egypt, Israel, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, and Jordan. The agriculture that first developed in this region was in the form of Animal Husbandry. Early humans in this region would domesticate various different animals, such as sheep, goats, cattle and pigs. These animals would be domesticated at various different periods in history dating back as far as 13,000 years ago to 10,000 years ago. The domestication of these animals would be the first step in creating a civilisation that could sustain a large population without the need for hunting to survive.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">The agriculture of plants would start later than that of animal agriculture with the earliest evidence of crops being farmed dating back 11,300 years ago, in the Jordan Valley of the Mesopotamian Fertile Crescent. Evidence for the farming of cereals such as wheat would appear 9000 years ago in what is modern-day Syria. Interestingly despite no global forms of communication being established, all the regions of the world would seem to adopt the concept of agriculture around this same period in time. In what is modern-day Mexico, early settlers would learn to harvest the fruit squash, 10,000 years ago. The Chinese would also be adopting agriculture by learning how to farm rice around 9000 years ago.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The reasons as to why early humans adopted agriculture over hunting are still much debated as no historical records exist from the time period to tell us why, so we rely on speculation, through the information we do know about the environment during this time period. The most commonly accepted theory is the same reason why humans shifted towards using ranged hunting weapons. It is believed that as the ice age ended and the climate warmed, the number of large beasts to hunt started to decline, meaning that large communities would find it much more difficult to sustain themselves off of hunting alone, this warmer climate also favoured the growth of plants significantly more than the previous climate, creating the perfect conditions for a shift towards agriculture.</p>
        
    
                <p class="articlepara">Today agriculture is just as important as it was in the past if not vastly more important. As of the year 2018 the global population stands at roughly 7 billion people, such an astronomical number could never be supported by hunting along especially considering the construction of cities means that many would have no grounds to hunt on. We have bent nature to our whim by advancing our technologies further to make agriculture on an industrial scale an easier and faster task to accomplish. We have gone as far to alter the very nature of the crops we grow through genetic modification so they may grow larger, grow in more plentiful numbers and be safe from pests that seek to destroy them.</p>
