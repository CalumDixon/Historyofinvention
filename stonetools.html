                <p class="articlepara">The use of stone tools dates back approximately 3.3 million years. It started when one of our prehistoric ancestors tried chipping away at a rock to shape it into a tool that could have been used for tasks such as cut meat or to crack nuts. 
</p>
                
                <p class="articlepara">The earliest evidence of stone tool use has been found in the Lomekwi 3 excavation site in West Turkana, Kenya. The specimen found predates the previously oldest known stone tool by 700,000 years. The tool found could easily be mistaken for an ordinary rock today but archaeologists were able to identify it as a tool as scars across the rock were too organised to have occured naturally.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">The stone tools that humans have used changed over the course of what scientists have identified as three distinct time periods; The Paleolithic period, the mesolithic period and the neolithic period.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">The Paleolithic period is the earliest of the three and one that the specimen found at the Lomekwi 3 excavation site. The tools during this period were primarily used for the butchering and hunting of animals and the chopping of plants and wood. While we know that early humans in this era used stone tools it is likely they used a multitude of different materials such as wood and bone that would not survive the test of time.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">The Mesolithic period is known for more advanced hunting tools. Although the bow and spear were present in the Paleolithic era, they were not as widely seen as they were in the Mesolithic period. The Mesolithic period is where we saw early humans create tools that were far more efficient by including alterations to their tools such as barbs on arrows or hooks on harpoon. A commonly accepted reason the advancement in tools such as these is that as the climate warmed the number of large beasts available to hunt shrank, this meant that tools such as the bow that would allow for  a ranged stealthy attack against smaller faster prey were needed.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">As the Neolithic era began the use of stone tools started to shift towards agricultural uses. stone tools such as the harvesting knife and the sickle began to rise in popularity. Despite evidence of grinding and drilling being used in tool making as early as the Paleolithic era it was not until the Neolithic that these practices became more common place. The likely reason for this shift in practice was because humans started to stay in larger groups such as villages. Farming was a much better and reliable way to provide for a larger group.</p>
                
                <p class="articleparaend articlepara"> Stone tools would have been one of the major advancements that sparked humanities progression towards being the dominant species that shapes the environment around them. An example would be the use of stone to create spearheads, the spear changed the fundamentals of hunting as it allowed for the earliest forms of fishing as well as the giving humans to ability to hunt with a range not previously seen in animals as their short arms made it possible to throw things with much more accuracy and distance compared to other primates.</p>
