                <p class="articlepara">Humanity’s rise to dominance would begin 3.3 million years ago when humans were in their primitive state and competing against other species within the Homo gene. It would all begin when one of our prehistoric ancestors started to bash rocks together to shape them into primitive tools. These early tools would have been used for basic tasks such as cracking nuts and butchering animals.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The earliest stone tool use can be dated back 3.3 million years, the tools were found in West Turkana, Kenya at the Lomekwi 3 excavation site. The tools that we found at the Lomekwi site could easily be mistaken for an ordinary rock today, but when looked at closer, archaeologists are able to identify the characteristics of early stone tools, such as the organisation of scarring on the rocks, showing that the stone tool was being hit against another rock to detach flakes of stone; this is a process called knapping. The specimen found in Lomekwi would predate the previously oldest known stone tools by 700,000 years, completely changing our perception of the technological progression of early humans.</p>
    
                <p class="articlepara">The stone tools that early humanity used would evolve over the course of time leading up to the bronze age. These tools are commonly separated into 3 distinct time periods; the Paleolithic period, the Mesolithic period and the Neolithic period.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The Paleolithic period, being the earliest of the stone age periods would have had the simplest tools, including those found at the Lomekwi 3 excavation site. The early tools of the Paleolithic period consisted of rocks that had, shaped to have an edge for chopping or a point for stabbing. These tools would have been used for the butchering and hunting of animals and the chopping of plants and wood. Towards the middle of the Paleolithic period, we can find clues that would suggest that this was the time period in which spears were invented. These clues include evidence such as thinned bases on stone points, suggesting that they were at some point hafted to a spear pole and early evidence of tar being used create composite tools. The late Paleolithic period would see further advancements with the creation of tools such as harpoons, bow and arrows and the spear thrower. There would also be evidence of a shift away from stone for certain tools, with the many of the tools such as spear throwers and needles being created with ivory, antler or bone as these materials lent themselves much better to carving and tools did not need to be strong.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The Mesolithic period is well known, for its advancement in hunting tools, many of the tools that became popular in the Mesolithic period were present in the late Paleolithic period, such as arrows, but their use would become much more widespread and frequent, for example, the majority of arrowheads came from the Mesolithic period. The Mesolithic period would also see the rise of more carefully crafted tools, examples include the introduction of barbs on arrowheads and spears or hooks on harpoons. The most commonly accepted reason for this shift in tool crafting is attributed to the warming climate that caused the number of large beasts available for hunting to shrink, giving humans no other choice but to adopt tools such as the bow and spearthrower that would give humans the ability to hunt in a stealthy manner using ranged attacks against smaller fast moving prey.</p>

                <p class="articlepara">The Neolithic period would see the rist of agricultural tools, stone tools such as the havesting knife and sickle which had existed before the Neolithic period started to become much more popular during it. The Neolithic period would also see the wider use of the uncommon advanced crafting techniques from the previous periods, such as grinding stone tools smooth and drilling into them. The largest change that we would see in the Neolithic period would be the crafting of much larger and heavier tools, such as the loom, used for creating textiles, which used large heavy stone loom weights. The reason for this change can be attributed to the introduction of agriculture, farming would become a primary source of food for early humans as it was a far more reliable method of providing food for a large community. Agriculture also brought an end to the nomadic lifestyle of early humans, where it would have previously been impractical to dedicate large amounts of manpower to carry large and heavy tools, such as the loom.</p>
                
                <p class="articlepara">Stone tools would be one of the first major advancements that would spark humanity’s rise to dominance over its environment, it would be the moment in history where we would harness the potential of our unique physical characteristics. Examples include the introduction of spears, unlike other primates, humans have uniquely short arms that provide less power, but are much better suited for throwing objects over much larger distances with accuracy, this also suited us much better as humans are not very good at stealth compared to other species so the ability to attack at range would be vital to our success. Through the crafting of tools, human’s would learn to shape their environment and reach their full potential, making them more successful in all of their endeavours. </p>
